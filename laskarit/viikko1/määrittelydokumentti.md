# Requirement specification

## Introduction
In this program the user can play the classic video game Tetris. Before the game begins the player has the option to change the background image and the music that is playing (or mute it).

## The user interface
The program consists of two views: the menu screen and the game screen.

### The menu screen
The menu screen features a list of the backgrounds available and a list of the soundtracks that can be set to play during the game. All the options appear as buttons that can be pressed. The player can begin the game by pressing the "Start new game"-button.

### The game screen
When the game begins the game window will appear with the chosen background. Polygons made from squares start falling down from the top of the screen and the player has to move the blocks around while they are still "in the air" and try to for complete rows. When a whole row is filled with blocks it disappears and frees up space for more blocks. The player moves the falling polygons with the arrow keys.
