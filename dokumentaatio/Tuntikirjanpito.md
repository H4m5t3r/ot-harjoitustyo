# Work time log

| day | time | what I did  |
| :----:|:-----| :-----|
| 19.3 | 1    | I read through the instructions and checked how the project directory should be structured |
||1| I looked up tutorials for making a Tetris game that I could have use of during the project |
|20.3|2| I planned the structure of the program and wrote down the requirement specifications |
|28.3|2| I created a Maven project in NetBeans and added it to the repository. I also made sure everything was working, added everything needed for tests, etc in the pom-file and tested the project on VMWare to check that the project could be run on the university's systems. |
||2| I worked on the game part of the project. |
|29.3|2| I completed a working (but buggy) version of Tetris |
||2,5| I did some debugging, created a test and started updating the project's documentation |
|30.3|1| I finished this week's documentation |
|4.4|3| I created a menu for the game. This took more time than it should have because I tried to get JavaFX Scene Builder to work with NetBeans but there were no instructions on how to do this in the course material and I could not get it to work on my own so in the end I had to make the menu from basic JavaFX code. |
