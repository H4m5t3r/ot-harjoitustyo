## Progress
**21.4**
* I redid the game logic to make it better and the program is now located in the folder called "TetrisBetter". I also worked on the Music class and it works as it should now.
* I decided to replace the 8-bit music alternative with a clarinet version of the melody since it was easier for me to just change the instrument in the program I used than using a separate program.
* The game logic will soon be ready and most of the work that is left is to implement JavaFX to visualize what is happening. Right now the menu is in an early stage and the game screen's only function is that it recognises input from the arrow keys and prints text.
